# About
This workflow helps you open webpages

# Setup
To use this workflow, open the ruby script step (the middle one in the workflow) and add your own URL.

Structure:

- It's just a simple list of switch statements in ruby so I'll explain how to add yours below:

when something is typed in
	when "g" ‚Üê this is your identifier
do something:
	open "https://google.com"

That's it, now open Alfred and run "open g" and the url should open.

Do this with any other URLs you want.
